Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall and Agile Methodologies in Software Development
1. Waterfall Methodology
The Waterfall Model is a linear, sequential software development approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. It follows a structured path:

 Phases of Waterfall:

Requirement Gathering → Design → Implementation (Coding) → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
 Key Features:

Well-defined, rigid structure
Extensive documentation
Minimal client involvement after the initial planning
Testing happens only after development is complete
 Best Used For:

Projects with fixed and well-defined requirements (e.g., government, banking systems)
Industries with strict compliance (e.g., healthcare, aerospace)
2. Agile Methodology
The Agile Model is an iterative and flexible approach where software is developed in small increments called sprints. Agile promotes collaboration, customer feedback, and adaptability.

 Phases of Agile Development:

Planning → Sprint Development (Design, Coding, Testing in loops) → Review & Feedback → Deployment → Ongoing Improvements
 Key Features:

Incremental delivery (working software released frequently)
High customer involvement and feedback loops
Continuous testing and improvement
Flexible and adaptable to changes
 Best Used For:

Fast-changing projects (e.g., startups, mobile apps, SaaS products)
Customer-driven software (e.g., e-commerce platforms, social media apps)
Key Difference:
Waterfall is structured and sequential, best for projects with fixed requirements.
Agile is flexible and iterative, ideal for evolving projects needing frequent changes.
